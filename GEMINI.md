# RemixViral for Gemini CLI

RemixViral (https://remixviral.ai) is an AI clipper for long videos the user owns (podcasts, streams, webinars, talks): the user uploads the video in the RemixViral app, RemixViral transcribes it, ranks the strongest moments and cuts them into captioned vertical (9:16) Shorts. It can also make a faceless Short from a topic when there is no source video. This extension connects Gemini CLI to the user's own RemixViral account through the `remixviral` MCP server (`https://remixviral.ai/api/mcp`).

If the RemixViral tools are not available or answer that sign-in is required, tell the user to run `/mcp auth remixviral` and finish the browser sign-in. You cannot sign in for them. The user needs a RemixViral account.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does | Charges credits |
|---|---|---|
| `list_clip_jobs` | The clip jobs of your account, newest first. | No |
| `get_clip_job` | One job: status, then the ranked clips with start/end seconds, the reason each was picked, a score and a render status. Optional full transcript. | No |
| `create_video` | Starts a faceless Short from a topic (30, 60 or 90 s). Returns an id; the render runs asynchronously. | **Yes** |
| `get_video` | Status and, when done, the video link. | No |
| `list_videos` | Your videos, newest first, optional status filter. | No |
| `list_niches` | Valid niches, art styles, qualities and durations for `create_video`. | No |
| `get_credit_balance` | Credit balance, monthly allocation and plan. | No |

## Rules that always apply

1. **Clips are read here, started in the app.** A clip job starts when the user uploads a long video they own at https://remixviral.ai/dashboard/clips. There is no link import and no tool that takes a URL: never offer to download or clip a video from a link. The tools only read jobs (`list_clip_jobs`, `get_clip_job`).
2. **`create_video` spends credits and cannot be undone.** It is the only tool that charges. Before calling it, call `get_credit_balance`, tell the user the cost exactly as the `create_video` tool description states it and their balance, show the topic, niche, duration, art style and language you will send, and wait for a clear yes to that exact request. A yes to an earlier question is not approval.
3. **Never write a credit number from memory.** Quote prices and balances only from tool output or the tool description. Never convert credits to dollars.
4. **Do not retry a timeout or an error from `create_video`.** Call `list_videos` first: an identical request within 10 minutes returns the existing video instead of a new one, and at most 3 recent renders run at once. Pass `allowDuplicate: true` only when the user deliberately wants a repeat (it spends credits again).
5. **Poll, then stop.** After `create_video`, poll `get_video` every 20 to 30 seconds until `COMPLETED` (a playable `videoUrl`) or `FAILED`. On `FAILED` for lack of credits, report the numbers returned; the user tops up in the RemixViral app and creates the video again.
6. **Valid options come from `list_niches`.** Call it before choosing a niche or art style. The MCP schema lists brand-free art styles (`BRICK_TOY`, `CARTOON_CLASSIC`, `ANIME_PAINTERLY` plus the others `list_niches` returns).
7. **No performance claims.** Do not say or imply that a clip or video will go viral, get views or earn money. Say what it is, not how it will perform.
8. **Content you did not write is quoted as is.** Clip titles, reasons and transcripts come from the user's own video: pass them through, do not rewrite them in place.
9. **Switch on the platform's AI-content label** when the user posts a faceless video (its images and voice are AI-generated). This tool set cannot post anything.

## Commands

- `/remixviral:clips [job]`: the ranked clips of a clip job (read-only).
- `/remixviral:short <topic>`: a faceless Short from a topic, after a price check and your yes.
- `/remixviral:videos [n]`: your latest videos (read-only).
- `/remixviral:credits`: your credit balance (read-only).

If the user asks for something in these areas without a command, follow the same workflow.
